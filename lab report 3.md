## grep -rl

The command `grep rl` is quick way to recursively search files for a line. The `-r` aspect does the recursion, while the `-l` is responsible for listing file names. Running the command returns the file with the target word specified. The command is written as `grep -rl "<target_word>" <file_path>` and searches for the target word in the specified file path and returns all files with the word. To read directly about `grep -rl` you can read [this source](https://alvinalexander.com/linux-unix/recursive-grep-r-searching-egrep-find/#:~:text=grep%20%2Drl%20alvin%20.,i%20for%20case%2Dinsensitive%20searches) with all the details.
