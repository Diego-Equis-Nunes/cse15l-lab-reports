# Researching Commands

The command `grep` is used to search for patterns within files. This document will be exploring examples of different command line options for the `grep` command. The foled `written_2/` will be searched through using the various `grep` commands present. 

## grep -rl

The command `grep rl` is a quick way to recursively search files for a line. The `-r` aspect does the recursion, while the `-l` is responsible for listing file names. Running the command returns the file with the target word specified. The command is written as `grep -rl "<target_word>" <file_path>` and searches for the target word in the specified file path and returns all files with the word. To read directly about `grep -rl` you can read [this article](https://alvinalexander.com/linux-unix/recursive-grep-r-searching-egrep-find/#:~:text=grep%20%2Drl%20alvin%20.,i%20for%20case%2Dinsensitive%20searches) with all the details.

## grep -rc

The command `grep rc` recursively searches files for a pattern and returns the count of lines with that pattern. The `-r` aspect triggers the recursion, while the `-c` is responsible for listing the count. Running the command returns the count of lines with the target word specified. The command is written as `grep -rc "<target_word>" <file_path>`. To learn directly about `grep -rc` you can read [this source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/) that I referenced.

## grep -rw

The command `grep rw` recursively searches files for a pattern and returns the count of lines with that pattern. The `-r` aspect triggers the recursion, while the `-c` is responsible for listing the count. Running the command returns the count of lines with the target word specified. The command is written as `grep -rc "<target_word>" <file_path>`.
