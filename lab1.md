# Remote Access with Github

In this post I'll go over the steps to create a website for lap reports, specifically as an incoming CSE15L student. You'll learn how to log onto a remote server under the CSE15L course specific account.

## Part 1 - Group up

First things first you'll get into a group of 6 students mentored by a teaching assistant for the course. You'll go to google docs and access a shared document to track your team's progress.

## Part 2 - Make a course specific account

In your groups, you'll each individually use the link [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php] to access your CSE15L specific account. You''ll be sent to a page with your course ID, which you then use to create an account with it as the username and a unique password of your choosing. Don't be afraid to ask your team members for help, as I learned that asking a friend sitting close by is what ensured this part of the process went smoothly. 

## Part 3 - Download Visual Studio Code

If you don't already have it installed as I did, you'll need to install visual studio on your device using the following link [https://code.visualstudio.com/]. If you are unable to install for any reason, you can also log into visual studio code on the lab computers.

## Part 4 - Connecto to the remote server

Once your account is created and visual studio code is involved, you will now connnect to the CSE15L remote server. You'll have to install Git on windows by using this link [https://gitforwindows.org/] and then open it in visual studio code by going to terminal and opening a new terminal. Fnially you'll type in the command "ssh cs15lwi23**zz**@ieng6.ucsd.edu" but replace the **zz** with your account for the course's letters. After doing so type "yes" to the message the terminal prompts and hit enter to complete the connection to the remote server.

## Part 5 - Test Commands

Once on the server, you can run some test commands in the terminal such as "cd ~" or "cd" or "ls - a" or the one I used which is "ls -lat" to see if you can work on the remote server. After successfully running some commands you can log off of the remote server using "control + D" or typing "exit" into the terminal.
